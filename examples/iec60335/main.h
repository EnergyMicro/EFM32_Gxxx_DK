/*! @defgroup IEC60335_EXAMPLE IEC60335 Class-B Library Example
* @{
* @brief The IEC60335 Class-B Library Example is a formal and simple software\n
* to show the usage of the iec60335_classb library.\n
* Easy and simple coded functions are showing most of the library functions.
* To run the example the following conditions are required:\n
* -# HiTOP for ARM Cortex or similar version and Debugging interface
* -# Hitex GCC 4.5.0 compiler for cortex
* -# Evaluation hardware from Energy Micro populated with EFM232G890F128 device
* -# knowledge of Cortex in general and the EFM device specificly
* Several Projects are implemented for the following tool chains:
* -# HiTOP for Cortex
* -# IAR Kickstart 6.1
* -# Keil uVision 4
* All the projects are related to the same source code. Special compiler specific\n
* mnemonics are defined and activated by the compiler by setting special defines\n
* during compilation and link process.
* Special focus must be set to the configuration and CMSIS library extension.

* @defgroup IEC60335_CONFIG Library Configuration
* @{
* @brief  This modules are prepared for specific devices and compilers.\n
* Changing any of this will cause non or mail functionality and requires\m
* new compilation and tests.\n
* Compiler specific issues must be regarded in concern to the user\n
* application. Specific modules have their own configurations to keep\n
* cross effects minimized.

* -# physical target devices
* -# other internal components and structures like memory size

* @{
* @brief  This modules is an extension to the EFM32 library.\n
* Here interrupt handler and exceptions are defined for direkt usage\n
* under CMSIS compliant software.
* @defgroup EXCEPTIONS Exceptions and default vectors
* @{
* @brief  This module defines a set of default handlers for the device\n
* specific interrupts. The module is an extension for CMSIS library.\n
* The handler can be replaced because they are defined "weak".
